This program is developed under Code::Blocks 12.11 with mingw gcc and runs on WIN32 platform.

It is recommended to install Code::Blocks 12.11 first, and then open Reversi.cbp for easy compiling.

The AI algorithm uses MinMax tree with alpha-beta pruning. Especially, it has a priority next-step mechanism to make alpha-beta pruning more efficient.

The search depth is 8 by default and is possible to deepen and parallelize in the future.

Furthermore, There is a benchmark option on the menu, which mainly tests the CPU's capability for integer.

Although this program is just a amateur program compared with other professional ones whose AI and UI are really good, it is, somehow, like my child.

I make it line by line, little by little, and spend much time testing and finding bugs on it.

There are still many places that could be enhanced such as parallelizing the AI algorithm, optimizing the priority next-step mechanism and etc.

At last, it is glad to meet you.
